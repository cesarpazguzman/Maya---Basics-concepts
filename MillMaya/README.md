There are three files. 
  - A image which was generated with the render mental ray of Maya. 
  - A video where the animations are shown (Animation of blades of the mill and of the camera)
  - The Maya scene. 

In this project, I modeled, textured a mill and animated their blades. Its aim was to introduce a little Maya and learn the basics. It also I've done a terrain made by sculpt option, and a sky was added in the Render View. 

Maya 2014 was used. I've done an online course, and this project is the result.
