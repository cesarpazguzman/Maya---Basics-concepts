This project is about the introduction in Maya. There are two folders:
  - The first one is a project where I modeled, textured a mill and animated their blades. There are the image generated for the render mental ray, a video and the Maya scene.
  - In the second one there are several scripts in Python using the module Maya.cmds. I've used the basics operations of this module.


The main goal was learn the basics concepts in the part artistic which every programmer should know for working in this industry.
